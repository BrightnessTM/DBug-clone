<h1>DBug-clone</h1>

This project goal is to recreate the Discord Testers Bug Bot called DBug in JS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è This is the **NOT** the same bot as the bot Discord Testers is using ‚ö†Ô∏è
This is just a recreation of that bot, because I thought it would be a fun project.

## Differences between the real and this clone
- The offical bot is written in Discord.py and the clone is written in Discord.JS
- The offical bot is closed source (as of now) and the clone open source

<h1>DBug-clone</h1>

This project goal is to recreate the Discord Testers Bug Bot called DBug in JS

## ‚ö†Ô∏è This is the **NOT** the same bot as the bot Discord Testers is using ‚ö†Ô∏è
This is just a recreation of that bot, because I thought it would be a fun project.

## Differences between the real one and this clone
- The offical bot is written in Discord.py and the clone is written in Discord.JS
- The offical bot is closed source (as of now) and the clone open source
- The offical bot is using Phabrictor and the clone is using Trello

- Some of the commands of the bot are Bug Admin only and thus I am not aware of them and thus not impleted into the clone bot, some of the commands are pure guesswork and that I belive is in the real bot.
